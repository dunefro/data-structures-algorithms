1. Linked, ordered, and unordered lists are grouped as heterogeneous data structures. Linear data structures are lists, sets, tuples, queues, stacks, and heaps. Trees, tables, and containers are categorized as nonlinear data structures. Two dimensional and multidimensional arrays are grouped as homogeneous data structures. Dynamic data structures are dictionaries, tree sets, and sequences.
2. In the `list.go` we don't need to explicitly convert the values to int. It will automatically be converted to the required values. Moreover we can also store string which means the below code snippet would work fine as well.
```
intList.PushBack("Hello")
intList.PushBack(23)
intList.PushBack(14)
```
